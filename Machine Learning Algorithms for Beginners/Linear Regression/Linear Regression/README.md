## 🛠️ Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then follow these steps:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SURESH745/Machine-Learning-Algorithms-for-Beginners.git
cd Machine-Learning-Algorithms-for-Beginners

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv ml_env
source ml_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use: ml_env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📖 Usage
Each folder contains a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) explaining the algorithm with hands-on coding examples. To run the notebooks:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open the `.ipynb` file from the respective algorithm folder.
